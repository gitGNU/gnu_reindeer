Reindeer is a C library for the rendering of virtual scenes, mainly in three
dimensions. The library dynamically loads backend modules to do the rendering.

Any number of rendering contexts can live at the same time. Contexts are tied to
a backend and backends are automatically loaded and unloaded on demand.
Resources are defined globally and can be used by any number of contexts at the
same time, even in different backends.

The main goal is to make it easier for developers to write applications that
have many rendering contexts with shared resources and automatic state
management. Another advantage is that the user can choose in which way a scene
should be rendered without recompiling the application. For example, a scene
could be rendered with a rasterizer like OpenGL at one point, and with a
raytracer at another. Reindeer can also be used to get portable graphics output.
Reindeer is not a scene-graph library or a game engine, but it can be used to
implement them.

It's still up to the application to create and manage the native contexts that
the Reindeer backends can work on. For example, an application would still need
to use GLX or equivalent to be able to use the OpenGL backend. The Reindeer
project also provides a package called GTK-Reindeer that makes this easier for
developers of GTK+ applications.
